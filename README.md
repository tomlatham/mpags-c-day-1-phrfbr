# mpags-cipher
A simple command line tool for encrypting/decrypting text using classical ciphers

##More details
To create a piece of code that can decypher and encrypt documents
This will involve learning C++ and other various software tools

##Requirements
Read Plaintext from Keyboard or File

User select of Cipher, Key and whether to Encrypt/Decrypt

Provide Encryption/Decryption via

Caesar Cipher

Playfair Cipher

Vigenere Cipher

Write Ciphertext to Screen or File

TEL: Great that you've noted these requirements here!

##Documentation

##How to install

TEL: Would be good to include the build instructions here.
     It does all build and function correctly - well done.

TEL: I'm noting this here in case I forget to mention it in the email to you: we would suggest not to commit the compiled binary into the repository, you should only have the source files under version control.  Also I noticed you had a .nfs.... file - don't commit those either (we can discuss what they are tomorrow if you like).

##Writing good commit messages
See exercise 21 of week 1

and exmaple is here:
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
